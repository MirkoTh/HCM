# Hierarchical Chunking Model

A cognitively inspired representation learning algorithm that learns a hierarchy of chunk representation from sequential data, guided by statistical dependencies between chunks.

### Running the code
```shell
python main.py
```

### Folder Content

/Demo: a set of jupternotebook demonstrations on learning chunk hierarchies on various types of sequential data.

/InputData: Datasets used to learn chunks.

/OutputData: Stores the output from running HCM, sometimes used for plotting in demonstrations
